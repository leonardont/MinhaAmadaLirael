<h3 align="center">Minha Amada Lirael takes place in a world where magic is marginalized and those who possess it are forced to live in the shadows for their entire lives.</h3>
<br>
<h4 align="center">The Wizard doesn't believe in this, but rather that those who are magical should be worshipped. His cruelty and ambition have made him known far and wide, feared everywhere, hated by many and ultimately alone. </h4>
<h4 align="center">Discontented with having his entire mansion to himself and motivated to make himself admirable to those who had previously despised him, the Magician wrote down in his magical book the greatest desires of men: a girl with delicate features and no desires, a blank slate to love and adore him, called Lirael.</h4>
<h4 align="center">His obsession with his creation soon prevented him from letting her go free, so the Magician locked her up in his mansion, far from any contact with the outside world. Lirael then, after years of enduring being trapped and confined under that cold roof, knew she had to escape.</h4>
